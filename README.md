Both the front as well as the back are running on a different **docker** image. In order to communicate them, we use **docker-compose**.

## Instruction

2. Install docker-compose
3. Clone the repo
4. Inside of the proyect, run **docker-compose up** or add **-d** to run it in the background
5. Go **http://localhost:5000** and it'll be running
